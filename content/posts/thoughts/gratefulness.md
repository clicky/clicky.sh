Yesterday I learnt my bus had no brakes. I learnt this on the 97 highway north after noticing a leak at a grocery store and booking in an appointment to get it looked at. I had told them I think it might be leaking brake fluid. After arriving safely (thank gosh) and learning first hand why buildings have concrete blocks in front of parking spaces, I headed inside to confirm I had indeed been leaking brake fluid, and my brakes no longer worked, although luckily the leak had stopped for some reason.

It could have been much worse. I could have found this out whilst driving down a steep forest road, hours from anywhere. 5 minutes away is about as good as I could hope for. 

I think my older self would have been quite annoyed about the situation, the cost, the inconvenience and general faff. But lately I've been contextualising my problems in a different context.

If I want something, I have to be okay with associated problems.

If the bus breaks down, that is part of living in a bus, it's bound to happen eventually. And if my problem stems from having something I want, then it's not a problem. And respectfully, I should _up the shut fuck_ and stop whinging. This isn't to disparage problems, it's just putting into context what that problem stems from. When I view my current situation through this lens many of my "problems" become not a problem. I'm stop being annoyed, I wander about my day happily and if anything, I can be thankful I have the bus at all.

### Small Caveat
> I'd still be annoyed if I fell off of the bus roof, or got crashed into, but I wouldn't consider that an associated or inevitable scenario. Likewise if I feel pressured and stressed due to my job, that's a real issue that I should take seriously and mitigate.
