When people ask me what I'd do if I won the lottery, I've always said I'd donate the majority of it, sell all my things and walk the earth until my legs won't walk any more. After that I have no idea. Quite rightly, a few people have pointed out to me that you don't need to win the lottery to own nothing. I think this is somewhat true.

I grew up in a household where everything was kept, it might be useful later. It'll come in handy. You never know when you'll need it. Just in case. It's for a rainy day, and so on. It's ingrained in me to keep odds and sods for the future, reuse, reduce, recycle etc. Not owning odds and ends means you will eventually need to buy them for the full inflated price later on, and possibly at an inconvenient time. 

That being said, needing to own things and owning things for the sake of it are two very different scenarios, and arguably, I don't _need_ to own things. I have no house to upkeep, no fence to keep painted, no car to maintain and so I probably don't need to worry about keeping odds and sods that I have nowhere to store.

Anyway, I've decided the few people who pointed this out are at least on the money that owning very little is something one can conceivably do. And so I've decided to try to reduce my possessions down to a goal and start walking. Partly because I've realised I don't like owning things, things take time and I'd rather do things than have things. Gandhi supposedly had ~ 10 possessions, a pretty incredible feat. I don't think I can quite get that low. I've lived before out of 2 bags for a few months, but they were heavy and I think much of that can be reduced.

So the goal is somewhere between 10 things and a carry on bag and a personal bag. As luck would have it a Serbian Businessman in an airport, who purported to be designing and making the first electric Ultra-car, told me about Wizz Airs unlimited fights club thing which allows you to fly a maximum of 3x a day every day all year for ~ 10EUR a flight (the catch is that booking must be done < 3 days in advance). So my initial goal is 1 bag that fits under a Wizz Air seat. 40 x 30 x 20 cm in size and under 10Kg. Brilliant, we have a dimensional and weighted goal!

Below is my attempt at figuring out the minimum collection of things I can live with. I'm quite sure that, like after moving into the bus, I'll figure out ways to pack better and realise there's many things I simply don't use or need. I can already say with confidence my Windows Laptop will be a thorn in my side until I can get a thinner ARM one and share chargers with my MacBook.

I won't list things consumables like shampoo, toothpaste etc as those can be bought on arrival at a destination and kept in the pocket of my jacket. 

Below is the list with some commentary, and for thoroughness I've also organised it on [lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com/r/h8bzdv) with weights etc.

I really can't oversell all of this Merino Wool stuff it works so much better for travelling with less items. It is easier to clean (e.g in a sink), it doesn't hold onto smells and it dries super quick. It might sound a bit TMI but if you want to reduce items this is a great start.

## Shoes
- Hiking boots (my feet need them)

- Z-Trail EV sandals, very small, light weight, well built, comfy, great for short walks and hotter weather.
