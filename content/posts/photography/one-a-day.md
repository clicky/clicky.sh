At some point during University I decided to take only 1 photo a day with my 35mm film camera gifted to me by my Gran. I had a lot of fun eyeballing the exposure (As you can see, to mixed success) and developing the film myself in the bath tub. The photos could likely do with some better scanning and more love, but I like that they look a bit amateur-ish.
