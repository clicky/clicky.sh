My first solo trip. I got the ticket after Jack's Flight Club recommended it. I do recall sitting next to a travel agent on the plane who told me quite smugly she paid 80 quid for her ticket and asked how much I'd paid and being quite confused how I'd snagged one for 50 quid.

I was quite surprised to see Dunkin' Donuts and Wendys here. I do also recall seeing McDonald's and couples wearing their Sunday best as the McDonald's was the fanciest restaurant in town. Certainly not the best tasting, but it stood out.

Lesson learned, if the price of your zoo ticket is 50 pence, don't go in.

I think about this bread at least twice a week. It was around 1 Euro equivalent, and it was delicious. Cheese infused bread sometimes with an egg in the middle. Absolutely delicious.

I found a small LGBT cafe that served vegan food in Georgia. They told me a lot of stories of people who did not agree with this cafe and protested them, sometimes violently. The proprietor also told me her dad did not know about it and she loved Dr Who. A kitten ran in one day under the counter.

I think this is the part of the holiday where I broke emotionally because my plans had fallen apart and it had all gone to shit and I needed to talk to someone and found some french people and followed them for a while.

There was a theme park on top of a hill, I asked if it was open and the cable car guy said yes, and it was absolutely not open. Bastard.

This chap insisted we have a photo together and took me around the Georgian Museum of Glory in Kutaisi showing me all of Georgia's triumphs.

There's lots of really good dinosaur fossils in Georgia. They had a park dedicated to dinosaurs that looked like it had run out of money and everyone was likely trespassing. The best part of this to me was it looked like Jurassic park (after the first movie).
