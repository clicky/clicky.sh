In British Columbia you can just buy a school bus and drive it, on a regular driving license provided you take the seats out and the signs down. It doesn't matter that it weighs 8 tonnes, it doesn't matter than it is basically a steel tank, it doesn't matter that your last car was a smart car, you're free to drive the length and breadth of one of the largest counties on earth.

Every day I drive it is a fun day, and everywhere I stay is a new place full of new adventures. It almost feels like too much fun and I keep thinking someone will stop me and tell me it is illegal to have so much fun.

It is undoubtedly the stupidest thing I've ever done, abandoning the stability and predictability of living in an apartment.

But then again, you can't beat these views.

Every morning the sun wakes me up

I look at the mountains

I write a little code

I look at the stars if the conditions are right

Then I go to sleep. And I would like to do this every day I can until I can no longer do these things.

Converted buses are rare. I have seen a few, but not a lot.

Sometimes I worry I'll get stuck. Them I remember this is fucking bus and it does not care.

I swam in this river one morning and felt quite free ~

It blows my mind there are campsites like this that are free for 2 weeks. I cackle myself to sleep every night at these. Take that landhoards.

The sun always lets me know when bed time is. Which means time to read a book :)

Roof solar panels are awesome. The whole bus is powered by solar and I find that immensely gratifying.

# Misc FAQs

### How do you cook? Deal with food?

Like regular people, but using camping equipment. It's much more flexible than having a fixed cooking stove. Most of the food in the fridge is vegetarian/vegan, I'm not strict about any particular diet I just like the taste of tofu and these kinds of foods last for months which is really useful if I intend to stay somewhere for a long time. I cannot express how much I do not want to endure food poisoning in the woods. The bus has a nice sized fridge and a small freezer. It doesn't take a lot of power (varies with the weather) but it is the most consistent power draw which takes most of the batteries because it runs 12 hrs a day (again, depending on the weather).

Delicious soup!

Tofu eggs, rice and veg

![](/bus-life/IMG20250925080733.jpg)

Pancakes! A rare but enjoyable treat.

### Cleanliness

The bus has a [composting toilet](https://natureshead.net/) which works very well, but if there are other toilets available I use those for obvious reasons. 

The bus has a shower which works OK. But it uses a lot of water so it's only used now and then. Some campsites have showers, which are fab. Mostly I swim in lakes. I don't take body wash into them I just use a little afterwards. I find this works a lot better than I would have expected. This is likely because I cannot grow hair, so, YMMV. For those with hair, washing in the sink works quite well. Covering your head with water is extremely refreshing and not having it makes me quite miserable, lakes are the best for this, even if a bit chilly, but I have plenty of insulation so I don't mind.

### Power, heat etc.

The internal electrics run on 2x 3600 kwh lithium batteries connected to an array of 4 solar panels. This is largely sufficient for most of the year. I have 2x 400W portable panels which are really good for VERY hot days when the bus needs to be in the shade.

The bus works like a greenhouse, it heats up very well and gets cold very well. Realistically the temperature inside is the same as the outside. Certainly at night. At night a big duvet and blankets regulate the temperature, that works even at -4C ish.

When it gets cold enough that heaters are required I go stay at RV campgrounds that offer power. It's not too expensive and means that I can stay comfy and warm. I use a little electric heater and have an AC/Heater unit which is very good at keeping too much moisture out of the air and keeping the bus toasty. There is also a diesel heater but I haven't got that working as well or as clean as I'd like.

I do think that if I was going to brave more months of the year in the bus I'd work on better insulation, fix up the diesel heater and get more solar panels and I'd be just fine. But I'm not going to do that so I've no real need.

### Where do you stay? How do you pick a route?

I just head in _A_ direction and see how that goes, often it might be towards where a friend lives and I'll leisurely make my way there. At some point I got used to having no schedule and nowhere to be which is quite freeing. You can't be a control freak about this kind of stuff, you have to relinquish total control and just see what happens. That being said, [Overlander](https://ioverlander.com/) is my best friend when finding places, and does allow for _some_ planning. I gladly pay the optional yearly subscription because of how much they've saved me and stress. I also make sure to add places and check-in for others.

Usually I'll create a map of all the places on the route I'm going and check out the top of my list and if that falls through, try option 2, 3, etc. I don't think I've ever gotten past option 2, and even that's rare. Rest stops are usually meh, (there's usually not much to do) but very dependable and the backbone of some longer trips. Casinos are very convenient, all of them will let you stay 1 night in their car park, they ask no money and there's no check-in or out times which for 1 night is perfect. They also have toilets which if not 24/7 will likely be 18/7, a coffee shop and restaurant which are often OK and fairly cheap (subsidised by gambled pensions). I'll often pick them over a campsite for a one night stop just due to convenience. For your first visit all of them will also give you about $10-$20 of "have fun" money. I always take this, gamble it and you're likely to win something back which I spend on lunch. I don't gamble otherwise, not my thing.

No one has ever asked me to move or told me I can't park somewhere when I was going to stay overnight. Someone once informed me I couldn't park in a particular spot, I asked what will happen if I do, and they told me I'd get towed. I informed them that a tow truck for an 8 tonne bus takes a minimum of 3 hours to arrive so I can park anywhere for at least 2 hours. Surprisingly enough to me, most people find the converted bus very cool, and I think enjoyable rebellious, so most people are very accommodating, excited to ask about it, and even more excited to come aboard and look around.
